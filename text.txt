I see a ripple far away,
In tides of sea,
And dunes of sand,
In palms by the beach that sway

In blades of grass,
And the shimmering waves,
Hurtling through time and space,
The burning distance will wax and wane,
It keeps me happily insane

There are times of crippling pain,
Spirits of rage and a smokey haze,
Try to send you astray,
You refuse to attenuate

My eyes open, I'm wide awake
Loneliness lurks, a panicky daze,
Your warm breath on my neck,
And I know it's all okay!

Happy birthday!!!
